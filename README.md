# Call-Centre-Dashboard

Created a dashboard showing detailed analysis of a call centre's trends in the first quarter of 2021. I was tasked with visualising the key performance indicators and the trends of customers and agent's behaviour overtime. The data consists of 5000 records and the KPIs focused on were overall customer satisfaction, overall calls answered/abandoned, calls by time, average speed of answer and performance of the agents. 

MS Excel was initially used to understand and format the data while Power BI service was used to analyse the data and create the dashboard.

The result from the analysis is shown below:
